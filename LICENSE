1. Grant of License

Sourcemeta ("Licensor") grants you ("Licensee") a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, and revocable License to use the Sourcemeta Registry
("Software") under the following editions:

- Starter (Free): Limited to 100 schemas per deployed instance of the Software.
- Pro (Commercial): Limited to 1000 schemas per deployed instance of the
  Software. Includes premium support.
- Enterprise (Commercial): No usage limits. Includes premium support. Includes
  commercial access to the Software's underlying dual-licensed code libraries
  maintained by Licensor under the same commercial terms.

Each License is separately granted to a single Entity, where Entity refers to a
single legal or natural person, including a company, nonprofit, and government
agency. Subsidiaries, affiliates, and related legal persons are considered
separate Entities. Licensee must refrain from obtaining a commercial License if
it is an Entity sanctioned by the Licensor jurisdiction.

2. Usage & Modification Rights

- The Licensee must not modify, disable, or circumvent any limits imposed by
  the Software or undermine the intended enforcement of any imposed limits.

- The Licensee must not resell, sublicense, or provide the Software in any way
  that directly competes with Licensor or as part of a service that provides
  similar functionality to the Software itself. Hosting publicly available
  instances of the Software is permitted as long as the instances are never in
  direct control of an Entity other than the Licensee's.

- If Licensee has a commercial License, Licensee may modify the Software

- If Licensee distributes commercial editions of the Software to another Entity
  for self-hosting purposes, Licensee must obtain a new paid License per Entity
  it distributes to.

Licensee is excused for unknowingly breaking these terms if Licensee takes all
practical steps to comply within 30 days of learning that the License terms
were broken. Otherwise, failure to comply results in immediate automatic
termination of this License without the right to a refund.

3. License Certificate & Compliance

issued by the Licensor and/or proof of payment to the Licensor for the monetary
amount published by Licensor at the time of purchase. The License is fully
refundable within 30 days of purchase. The Licensee is responsible for all
taxes, withholdings, duties and levies arising from the order.

Licensor reserves the right to audit the Licensee's compliance with this
License, including, but not limited to requesting usage reports and software
logs, and investigating potential circumvention attempts. Licensee must provide
proof of compliance within 14 days of an audit request.

Licensor reserves the right to amend this License at any time. Any
modifications will apply at the time of renewal and will not affect existing
active License agreements between Licensee and Licensor.

  use of the Software other than permitted by its free or open source tiers (if
