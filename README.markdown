## :page_facing_up: License

While the project is publicly available on GitHub, it operates under a
[source-available
license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/registry/blob/main/LICENSE) rather than
a traditional open-source model. You can use the [Starter
edition](https://github.com/sourcemeta/registry/pkgs/container/registry) for
free, but using any other edition for any purpose other than for contributing
back to the project requires a [paid commercial
license](https://registry.sourcemeta.com/commercial/).

> We are typically happy to provide free commercial licenses to open-source
> projects, non-profits, educational institutions, and research projects.
