# Buy a Commercial License

*Ready to scale your JSON Schema management? Our commercial licensing ensures
you have the tools and support needed for enterprise deployments while
contributing to the continued development of industry-leading JSON Schema
technology.*

The Sourcemeta JSON Schema Registry is [publicly available on
GitHub](https://github.com/sourcemeta/registry) with full source code
transparency, enabling comprehensive auditing and community contributions.
While the codebase is accessible for review and collaboration, the Registry
operates under a [source-available
license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/registry/blob/main/LICENSE) rather than
a traditional open-source model.

## Editions

You can use the Registry at no cost with all features included for
non-commercial and evaluation purposes. However, commercial deployments require
a license from Sourcemeta. This licensing model enables us

- Maintain and enhance the Registry's advanced capabilities
- Provide enterprise-grade support and reliability
- Continue investing in cutting-edge JSON Schema tooling development

## Our Commitment to Excellence

Sourcemeta is led by a member of the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee,
ensuring our solutions meet the highest industry standards and remain aligned
with JSON Schema ecosystem developments. As an independent, bootstrapped
company without venture capital backing, we maintain complete focus on
delivering nothing less than exceptional JSON Schema tooling.
